# Test Cases
Test cases are placed in a subfolder in the ./tests/ folder and must contain a test.json file.

format of test.json:
- name = name of the test (sent in subject)

- attachments = a list of files to attach to the email

# Google 2FA workaround
If you're using a google account with 2FA, you will need to create an AppPassword. This is a randomly generated password that allows logging in without 2FA. I wouuld not recommend keeping this password for a long period of time and would recommend deleting the password from your account as soon as it is no longer needed.
